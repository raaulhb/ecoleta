## üíª About the project

‚ôªÔ∏è Ecoleta - is a way to connect companies and waste collection entities to people who need to dispose of their waste in an ecological way.

Companies or entities will be able to register on the web platform by sending:
- an image of the collection point
- entity name, email, and WhatsApp
- and the address so it can appear on the map
- in addition to selecting one or more collection items: 
  - light bulbs
  - batteries
  - papers and cardboard
  - electronic waste
  - organic waste
  - cooking oil

Users will have access to the mobile application, where they can:
- navigate the map to see registered institutions
- contact the entity through Email or WhatsApp

Project developed during the **NLW - Next Level Week** offered by Rocketseat.
NLW is an online experience with a lot of practical content, challenges, and hacks where the content is available for one week.

## üöÄ How to run the project

We can consider this project as being divided into three parts:
1. Back End (server folder)
2. Front End (web folder)
3. Mobile (mobile folder)

üí°Both Front End and Mobile need the Back End to be running to work.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have installed on your machine the following tools:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), Node.js. 
It's also good to have an editor to work with the code like VSCode

### üé≤ Running the Back End (server)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https:https://github.com/raaulhb/ecoleta

# Access the project folder in the terminal/cmd
$ cd ecoleta

# Go to the server folder
$ cd server

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
